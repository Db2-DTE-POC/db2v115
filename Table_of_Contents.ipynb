Note that two of the notebooks cover the JSON functions that were added to Db2 in 10.5 and officially published in 11.1. These functions are used to support the MongoDB compatibility features in Db2, but are not part of the SQL standard. If you want to use the official JSON functions then you need to use Db2 11.5.\n",
